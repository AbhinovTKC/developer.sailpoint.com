# SaaS Configuration

This is a guide on using the SailPoint SaaS Configuration APIs in order to import and export configurations from the SailPoint SaaS system.  This is intended to be used to get configurations in bulk in support of environmental promotion, go-live, or tenant-to-tenant configuration management processes and pipelines.

For more details around how to manage configurations, refer to [SailPoint SaaS Change Management and Deployment Best Practices](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/IdentityNow-Articles/SailPoint-SaaS-Change-Management-and-Deployment-Best-Practices/ta-p/189871).
