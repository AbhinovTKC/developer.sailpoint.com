title: Operations

This document lists each type of operation you can perform in a transform. Sometimes you will hear these transforms referred to as **Seaspray**, the codename for transforms.

## Transform Operations

Seaspray ships out of the box with a number of primitive operations. The following sections describe the operations.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
