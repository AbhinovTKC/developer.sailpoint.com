# High-level Guidelines

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)).
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Issue your pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that
covers the project.

# Report Bugs Using Our Repository's [issues](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. We use GitHub issues to track bugs publicly.
Report a bug by
[opening a new bug](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+Your+Bug+Report+Here);
it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports With Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great bug reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or description
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happens
- What actually happens
- Screenshots!
- Operating System
- Browser
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

# Make A Feature Request Using Our Repository's [issues](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. Request a feature request by
[opening a new feature request](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D+Your+Feature+Request+Here);
it's that easy!

## Write Feature Requests With Detail

**Great feature requests** tend to:

- Say if this is related to a problem (and describe said problem)
- Describe the solution you'd like
- Describe alternatives you use or have considered
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might benefit others, too)

# Submit a Fix

Looking to take on fixing something yourself? Great! Here's the short on how to
do it:

- Fork the repository, copy the main branch only
- Pull down the code, build, and ensure it's running properly
- Create a new branch from main with the naming convention `fix/your-fix-name`
- Create a pull request from your branch to our origin repository's main branch!

# Submit a New Feature

Looking to take on adding a new feature? Great! Here's the short on how to do
it:

- Fork the repository, copy the main branch only
- Pull down the code, build, and ensure it's running properly
- Create a new branch from main with the naming convention
  `feature/your-feature-name`
- Create a pull request from your branch to our origin repository's main branch!

# Discuss, Submit General Issue, or Ask a Question

If none of the above work, you can submit a general issue using GitHub's
[issues](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/developer.sailpoint.com/issues). You
can also head over to the
[Developer Community forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss) to discuss
with us directly on the forum about what you're thinking!

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
