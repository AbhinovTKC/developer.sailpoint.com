# Source Deleted Trigger

## Event context

Source Deleted events occur when a source is successfully deleted via the API or the Admin UI.

Some uses cases for this trigger include:

- Provide evidence to show auditors that connector logic and sources are not manipulated outside of proper change control processes.
- Alert admins in the event that a source was wrongfully deleted.
