# Source Created

## Event context

Source Created events occur when a new source is successfully created via the API or the Admin UI.

Some uses cases for this trigger include:

- Provide evidence to show auditors that connector logic and sources are not manipulated outside of proper change control processes.
- Auto-configure new sources with proper owners using external data sources.
